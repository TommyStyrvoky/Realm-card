# Realm-card
A compact ESP32 TFT display/lipo charge circuit prop that loops through animations stored in folders on ÂµSD card attached to PCB. Estimated battery life is ~2 hours.

See Adafruit BOM for additional components needed for the electronics aside from PCB, these were purchased through Adafruit's store, Digi-Key, and Mouser Electronics.
The ESP32 QT-PY will need to be soldered flush onto pads on the PCB, the throughholes are provided for alighment, this should be mounted flush, see assembly directory for photos.

Included are KiCAD files for the PCB, there is a custom footprint that was created for the Adafruit QT-PY included.

All production files are set up for manufacture using JLC PCB's service. BOM's and placement files are provided, missing parts may need to be substituted due to component shortages.
